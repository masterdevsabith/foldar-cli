# seta - Next.js Project Scaffolder

`seta` is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the setup of new Next.js projects. It provides a structured boilerplate with essential components and configurations, allowing developers to kickstart their projects quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Directory Structure:** Generates a logical and organized folder structure for your Next.js application, including dedicated directories for components, types, public assets, and common pages like "about", "contact", and "blogs".
- **Pre-built UI Components:** Includes ready-to-use UI components such as a responsive navbar, a customizable button component, and theming utilities (theme provider and theme switcher).
- **Dark Mode Support:** Integrated dark mode capabilities using Tailwind CSS `dark:` utilities for a modern user experience out of the box.
- **Type-Safe Development:** Provides a `uiTypes.ts` file for defining common UI-related types, promoting type-safe and maintainable code.
- **Hero Section Template:** Scaffolds a basic `Hero.tsx` component, offering a starting point for your main landing page content.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Organizes components into `ui` (reusable, atomic components) and `includes` (layout-specific components like Navbar) for better maintainability.
- **Boilerplate `page.tsx`:** Generates a basic `page.tsx` file for the root of your application, integrating the scaffolded components.

## Installation

To install `seta`, you'll need to clone the repository and install it in editable mode using `pip`.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/seta.git
   cd seta
   ```

Install in editable mode:

This allows you to run the CLI directly from your local clone and any changes you make to the Python code will be immediately reflected.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
pip install -e .

Note: If you encounter issues, ensure you have pip and Python correctly installed and configured in your environment.

Usage

Once installed, you can use the seta CLI to create a new Next.js project by simply specifying the desired project path.

Creating a New Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, use the next_create command followed by the path where you want your project to be generated.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
seta next_create my-nextjs-app

Replace my-nextjs-app with the name of your desired project folder.

Showing Version Information

To check the current version of the seta CLI, use the version command:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
seta version
Generated File Structure

After running seta next_create my-nextjs-app, the following directory structure will be created inside my-nextjs-app:

Components Included
components/includes/Navbar.tsx

A boilerplate Next.js navbar with three main divisions (left, middle, right) styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a logo on the left, navigation links in the middle, and authentication buttons on the right. Includes dark mode support using Tailwind’s dark: utilities.

components/ui/Button.tsx

A basic, reusable button component styled with Tailwind CSS, ready for customization.

components/ui/theme-provider.tsx & components/ui/theme-switcher.tsx

Essential components for implementing a robust theming system (light/dark mode) in your Next.js application. theme-provider.tsx sets up the context, and theme-switcher.tsx provides the UI to toggle themes.

types/uiTypes.ts

A TypeScript file to define interfaces and types relevant to your UI components, ensuring better code organization and type safety.

components/Hero.tsx

A template component for a hero section, typically found at the top of a landing page, ready for content population.

page.tsx

The root page of your Next.js application, demonstrating how to integrate the generated navbar and hero components.

Requirements

To run the generated Next.js project, you will need:

Node.js (LTS recommended)

npm or Yarn

To develop and use the seta CLI:

Python 3.7+

pip

Development

If you're interested in contributing to seta or modifying its behavior, here's how to get started:

Clone the repository:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
git clone https://github.com/your-username/seta.git
cd seta

Install in editable mode:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
pip install -e .

This ensures that any changes you make to the Python source files are immediately reflected when you run seta commands.

Project Structure:
The Python code for the CLI is structured as a package.

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
seta/
├── seta/ # Python package directory
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── **main**.py # Main CLI entry point
│ └── code_templates.py # Contains all multi-line string component templates
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml # Project metadata and dependencies
└── setup.py # (Optional, if using setuptools for packaging)

seta/**main**.py: This file contains the typer application setup and the core logic for the next_create command, including directory creation and writing component files.

seta/code_templates.py: All the multi-line string constants for the Next.js component templates (e.g., NAVBAR_CODE, BUTTON_CODE) are stored here for clean separation.

pyproject.toml: Defines project metadata and dependencies.

Running the CLI during development:
To run the CLI and test your changes, always use the python -m flag when inside the seta root directory:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
python -m seta next_create my-test-app

This ensures that Python correctly resolves relative imports within the seta package.

Roadmap

Add more boilerplate pages (e.g., contact form, blog post template).

Implement optional component choices (e.g., different navbar styles).

Integrate state management library boilerplate (e.g., Zustand, Jotai).

Add unit testing setup for Next.js components (e.g., React Testing Library).

Support for different CSS frameworks (e.g., styled-components, Emotion).

Documentation for generated components.

Configuration file for seta to allow custom component paths or names.
